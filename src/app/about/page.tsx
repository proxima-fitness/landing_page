          Our Story: From Setbacks to Strength

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
            In 2020, my journey to fitness started under less-than-ideal circumstances. I was in a tough spot - recovering from a breakup, feeling skinny fat, and unhappy with how I looked and felt. My energy was low, my confidence was lower, and I knew something had to change.

          </ul> */}

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
          I took my first step toward transformation by hiring a personal trainer. It was an investment, and while I learned a lot, I found myself yearning for more advanced exercises and methods. I dove into the vast library of YouTube fitness channels, soaking up the expertise of bodybuilders and fitness influencers. Slowly but surely, I started building muscle, learning to control my nutrition, and shedding fat.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
          When my career began in 2021, life became busier. The demands of work meant less time for the gym, and while I stayed consistent, I found myself hitting a plateau. Progress slowed, and I started to feel stuck - something I knew many people experience when balancing fitness with real-life responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
          In 2022, a heavy squatting session led to a knee injury: a torn meniscus. The injury was a significant setback, both physically and mentally. I lost muscle mass in my legs and felt demotivated about training. The gym, which had been my sanctuary, became a source of frustration.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
          But every setback is an opportunity for a comeback. In 2023, I channeled my passion for fitness and my experiences into something bigger - Proxima Fitness. I wanted to create a platform that would help intermediate lifters, like myself, push through plateaus, manage the challenges of work-life balance, and continue progressing even when life throws curveballs.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
          Fast forward to 2025, and Proxima Fitness has officially launched. As I prepare for knee surgery, Iâ€™m excited to recover and rebuild with the very tools Iâ€™ve helped create. Proxima isnâ€™t just a product; itâ€™s the culmination of years of hard work, learning, and overcoming obstacles.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
          This journey has been about more than just getting jacked - itâ€™s been about resilience, adaptation, and sharing the lessons Iâ€™ve learned with others who are ready to transform their own lives.
